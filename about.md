<p class="lead">The Nylas Paper Reading Group is a collection of people who like to read technical papers and really like to discuss them.</p>

The papers we choose to read are typically computer systems related, but not always. We meet once a month at NylasHQ. Dinner is usually provided and discussion, always.

This blog is mostly to keep notes on papers we have read. Tweet at [@nylas](https://twitter.com/nylas) if you have ideas or feedback. Thanks!

<p class="lead">Code of Conduct.</p>

Don't be a jackass.
