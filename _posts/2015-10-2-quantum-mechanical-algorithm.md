title: A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search

description:

This paper applies quantum computing to a
mundane problem in information processing and presents
an algorithm that is significantly faster than any
classical algorithm can be. The problem is this: there is
an unsorted database containing N items out of which
just one item satisfies a given condition - that one item
has to be retrieved.  The most efficient classical algorithm for
this will look at an average of N/2 items before finding the desired item.
The number of steps required by the algorithm of this paper is O(N^1/2).
