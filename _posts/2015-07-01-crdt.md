title: "CRDTs: Consistency without Concurrency Control"

description: "A CRDT is a data type whose operations commute when they are concurrent. Replicas of a CRDT eventually converge without any complex concurrency control. As an existence proof, the paper presents a non-trivial CRDT: a shared edit buffer called Treedoc."
