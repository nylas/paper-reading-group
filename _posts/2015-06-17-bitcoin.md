title: "Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System"

description:

The original Bitcoin paper -- this paper proposes a solution to the double-spending 
problem in digital currency using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions 
by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, 
forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.
