title: "Dynamo: Amazon's Highly Available Key-value Store"

description: This paper presents the design and implementation of Dynamo, a
highly available key-value storage system that some of Amazon’s
core services use to provide an “always-on” experience. To
achieve this level of availability, Dynamo sacrifices consistency
under certain failure scenarios. It makes extensive use of object
versioning and application-assisted conflict resolution in a manner
that provides a novel interface for developers to use.
