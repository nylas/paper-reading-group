title: Virtual Time and Global States of Distributed Systems

description:

A distributed system can be characterized by the fact
that the global state is distributed and that a common
time base does not exist. However, the notion of time
is an important concept in every day life of our decentralized
"real world" and helps to solve problems like
getting a consistent population census or determining
the potential causality between events. We argue that a
linearly ordered structure of time is not (always) adequate
for distributed systems and propose a generalized
non-standard model of time which consists of vectors
of clocks.
